Application Parameters
---------------------
Ths tells what kind of execution you want to run.

Number of objects

Algorithm Parameters (")
Algorithm execution Parameters - write pattern, read pattern, number of writers, number of readers,
 
Any other experiment Parameters : Failure pattern etc


Service Parameters
------------------

Deployment Parameters - total number of processes,  process type for each, max number of objects per process, max file size, min file size,
Supported Algorithm Parameters- what algorithms does the service support. Defaults for each of those.

A. For PRAKIS
-------------

There are a few things that can be done to improve the speed of operations, and these are specifically due to the nature of the 
implementation. 

1. In the way we implement point to point channel, we first poll zmq sockets that have packets, and then receive from them. 
In this case, it makes sense to read the content of each of these packets, and possibly use them, even if we have already received
K packets that the algorithm phase expects. For example, consider the first phase of read operation. It is likely that we poll 
N sockets, and it can happen that there is a subset of K sockets that have common tag. But becuase we only receive from the first
K (and we simply discard the remaining packets in the current implementation), we miss out on the possibility of decoding in phase 1
itself

2. It makes sense to retain the list of the coded elements corresponding to max tag from phase 1, while listening to phase 2 durin
the read operation. This way, the read can potentially complete faster.
